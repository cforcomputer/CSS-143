    In Java, when you use curly braces, where should the right curly brace be line up to (regardless of whether you use the Allman or K&R styles)?

    Do Self-Test Exercise 12 on p. 199 of Savitch.

Answers:

    A prohibited consultation would involve copying directly the content of another student’s work from a past section. This would be considered cheating as you are copying work that is not your own – then claiming it as your own for credit.
    Any scenario in which you copy answers from quizzes are exams from prior sections would constitute cheating, as you can potentially memorize the answers and not learn anything new. This is cheating yourself of a proper education along with the typical cheating of using material directly from past sections.
    According to the Coding Style Guidelines section: “Whenever you use curly brackets, the ending right curly brace must line up with the starting item (what appears just before the left curly brace).” This is the general rule and applies to both Allman and K&R styles.
    A documentation block for a method/function should include: a verb (an action, since the method is always performing an action that accomplishes something).
    Write a method called advanceYear that could be added to the class DateThirdTry in Display 4.4 (p.194). The method advanceYear has one parameter of type int. The method advanceYear increases the value of the year instance variable by the amount of this one parameter.
        ANS:
        public int advanceYear(int input)
        {
        return year += input;
        }
    Rewrite the method getMonth in Display 4.2 using the `this` parameter.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DateSecondTry {
    private String month;
    private int day;
    private int year; // a four digit number

    public void writeOutput()
    {
        System.out.println(month + " " + day + ", " + year);
    }

    public void readInput()
    {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter month, day, and year.");
        System.out.println("Do not use a comma.");
        month = keyboard.next();
        day = keyboard.nextInt();
        year = keyboard.nextInt();
    }

    public int getDay()
    {
        return day;
    }
    public int getYear()
    {
        return year;
    }

    public int getMonth()
    {
        if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("January"))
            return 1;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("February"))
            return 2;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("March"))
            return 3;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("April"))
            return 4;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("May"))
            return 5;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("June"))
            return 6;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("July"))
            return 7;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("August"))
            return 8;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("September"))
            return 9;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("October"))
            return 10;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("November"))
            return 11;
        else if (this.month.equalsIgnoreCase("December"))
            return 12;
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Fatal Error");
            System.exit(0);
            return 0; // Needed to keep the compiler happy
        }
    }
}
