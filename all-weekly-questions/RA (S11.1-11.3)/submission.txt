// Doesn't solve all the cases
// It does something really weird when it finishes.
// Looking back, I shouldn't have declared count inside the 
// method. However putting outside makes it fail more cases?

// Also tried this

// Simplified version of the same thing

// Questions:
// Why is the base case either 1 or 0, even in the context of a problem like this?
// What is the most efficient method for returning the count? Is there a better way to keep track of it?
